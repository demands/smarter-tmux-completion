# Improved tmux bash completion

If you're trying to complete after using the `-t` option, complete with
all of the current tmux sessions. I know that sometimes you'll actually
need one of the clients, windows, or panes, but I think in the vast
majority of cases the user is looking for sessions.

There's an [open pull request to merge something like this into the official
tmux bash completion
plugin](https://sourceforge.net/p/tmux/tmux-code/merge-requests/7/). Until
then, you can use this!
